LimineUpgrader - By Dusk - Released under The Unlicense
Project *NOT* endorsed by Limine

This is really just a small collection of files that adds a hook for Arch Linux to update Limine's stuff when you upgrade it.

This project requires:
 - Limine
  ` https://github.com/limine-bootloader/limine
 - efibootmgr
  ` https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/efibootmgr/
 - Arch Linux (as if I didn't already say that)
  ` https://archlinux.org/

Install instructions:

1. Ensure you're running Arch Linux.
2. Clone the repo locally somewhere
3. Open src/update-limine.sh and go to line 20

You will find this:
	efibootmgr --create --label "Limine" --disk /dev/sdX --part 1 --loader '\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI'
Replace '/dev/sdX' with your disk.
Replace the label with your EFI entry name - If you can't remember it, use 'efibootmgr' to do it.

4. Write to the file, then run ./install.sh - You may need to 'sudo chmod +x install.sh' before you do.

!!!!!!! BEFORE YOU RUN !!!!!!!!
In the script's current state, it will make more of
the exact same goddamn boot entry. I don't know why,
but hopefully I can fix it soon. Maintainers or
fixers extraordinarily welcome.

Basically, make sure to remove any previous versions
of the boot entry you wanna make.

1. Run 'efibootmgr' and find the entry
2. Exterminate it like a certain yelling salt shaker - 'sudo efibootmgr -b <boot entry number> -B'
